# Simple ESP32 Weather Station

This is a simple ESP32 Weather Station that uses a WiFi connection to transmit sensor readings collected from a pair of i2c devices.

I am using a Lolin32 Lite, a BME280 and a APDS9960 because I have them lying around at home!

This example is all programmed using the official Micropython port for the ESP32 (link)

I also use libraries provided by Paul Cunnane and Peter Dahlebrg (BME680), and Liske (APDS9960)
