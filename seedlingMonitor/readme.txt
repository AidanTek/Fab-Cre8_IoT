This is a MicroPython project for the ESP32
Any ESP32 dev board is suitable, I am currently using the Lolin32 lite

The project is a simple environmental monitoring system to report on the immediate ambient conditions in close proximity to your seedlings.

The ESP32 is used as a MQTT client to send data to the Thingspeak MQTT Broker service.

myNet.py needs to be modified with your network settings. All files excluding this one should be copied to the ESP32 board.

Please visit http://micropython.org/ for more information on setting up the ESP32 and please visit Fab-Cre8.wordpress.com for more information on our projects
